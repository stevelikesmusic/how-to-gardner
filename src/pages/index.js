    <h2>Hi there, you</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Steve. My 10 second TLDR; is I like to create. I used to play
      music, now I write code at Zapier. My family is amazing, and we travel all
      over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to know more about me, the family, or what weâ€™re doing, you
      can checkout the about page, or look us up on any of these fine platforms
      below:
    </p>
    <SocialLinks />
    {Object.entries(SECTIONS).map(([link, label], i) => (
      <p key={i}>
        <Link to={`/${link}`}>{label}</Link>
      </p>
    ))}
  </MainLayout>
)

export default IndexPage
